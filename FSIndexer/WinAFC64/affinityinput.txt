# WinAFC Input File
#
# Lines that start with a '#' and empty lines are ignored. 
# Configuration lines include global flag setting lines, and application profile
# lines. These lines can be interleaved in any order. However, the order in which
# you specify the various application profiles matters if a process could be
# matched by multiple application profiles.

# To run AffinityChanger in TestMode (no affinity settings are modified),
# uncomment the line below and specify a value different than zero. To disable 
# test mode, set the value to 0 or comment the line below.
# It is recommended that you try the input file in test mode first, after you
# make changes, especially if you are unfamiliar with the syntax.
TestMode = 0

# There are several flags that control the verbosity of the program. 
# In general, a higher value means a more verbose output. These flags can 
# be also modified at run-time.

# By default the warning level is set to 2. To change it, uncomment the next 
# line and specify a value>=0. Zero disables warning messages (not recommended).
#WarningLevel = 2

# Logging is done on both console and in a file called 'affinitylog.txt'. 
# Separate flags control the verbosity for each medium. By default the logging
# level is set to 3. Uncomment the next lines to change the values of these 
# flags.
# To change only the console verbosity:
ConsoleLogLevel = 4
#
# To change only the file verbosity:
#FileLogLevel = 3
#
# To change both mediums at the same time:
#LogLevel = 3

# By default AffinityChanger checks for new processes every 30 seconds.
# To change how frequently AffinityChanger checks for new processes or adjusts
# affinities for existing processes, uncomment the line below and specify the
# number of seconds between consecutve process checks. The minimum accepted 
# value is 1 and the value can be only an integer number.
TimeInterval = 10

# One can change the value of a flag multiple times. In these cases the 
# most recently specified value will take effect.

##################################################
#
# An application profile is specified on a single line. 
# An application profile includes the following information: an application
# name, a CPU mask, and optional attributes in the following format:
# C:\Path\To\Application := CPU0+CPU1 [attr1=val1,attr2=val2]

# Check the documentation and the provided examples for more
