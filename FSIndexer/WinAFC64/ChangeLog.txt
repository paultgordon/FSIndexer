2009-01-04  Version 0.9.2
Changes:
- added support for realtime priorities;
- user must explicitly enable the use of realtime priorities from
  within the general settings dialog box;
- adjusted slightly upwards the load applied to the CPU to wake it 
  up from a low power state before the CPU detection heuristic.


2008-11-17  Version 0.9.1
Bug fixes:
- removed compile setting that was preventing the program to execute on 
  some systems;
- fixed bug that was causing the icon not to be restored in the systray 
  after an explorer crash;

New features:
- added a dialog box for changing program settings at run-time and for
  specifying default startup options;

Changes:
- moved the restore affinity settings from the context menu to the new
  general settings dialog box;
- when in test mode, the program prints a note at the end of each
  affinity changing log message to inform the user that affinity was
  not actually modified.


2008-10-28  Version 0.9
First public release of WinAFC
New features over AffinityChangerConsole v0.83:
- program installs an icon in the systray that enables some interaction 
  between the user and the program through a pop-up menu;
- program creates a console for displaying messages to the user (not really 
  a new feature, but emulating a characteristic of the console version);
- console can be hidden/shown on demand; messages still routed to the console
  while it is hidden and will be visible when console is opened;
- can also hide/show the icon in the systray. When the icon is hidden there 
  is no visible sign of the program on the desktop (except for the process 
  being visible in the Task Manager), and there can be no interaction with 
  the program;
- program can be started in stealth mode (no icon or console visible) by
  specifying command line parameter "-hideicon" in the shortcut;
- if icon is hidden, it can be made visible by attempting to start another
  instance of the program. The icon of the first instance will be shown in
  the systray and no new instance is created;
- pop-up menu enables loading of new affinity profiles (new profiles replace
  the old profiles), pausing and re-staring of WinAFC, restoring affinities 
  of affected processes before loading a new configuration file, before 
  pausing or before exiting WinAFC.
- output warning/error messages to the log file + the console

2008-10-28  Version 0.83
Bug fixes:
- made the CPU detection heuristic more resilient to variations in core speeds;
- cosmetic change: LOG messages print each CPU only once as part of a CPU mask.


2008-10-01  Version 0.82
New features:
- user can modify the default time interval between affinity readjustments 
through a configuration file flag called TimeInterval
- added a new optional profile attribute "force" which causes AffinityChanger
to re-set affinities for matching processes if they are changed by another
program or manually by the user. Previous versions and the default behavior 
in version 0.82 is to change affinities for processes only first time they 
are encountered or if a readjustment is needed because of a change in the 
number of matching processes or their load.
- new command line parameter "-startdelay" to specify a delay in seconds
before the prorgam starts executing. This flag is useful if AffinityChanger
is set to run automatically when Windows starts up, to allow Windows to
finish initialization a bit faster.
- ability to change affinity and priority of processes running under
different user accounts and of most system processes if AffinityChanger 
is started as Administrator.

Bug fixes:
- improved the method of waking CPUs from a low power state to perform the
CPU detection heuristic. This method should reduce the number of failed
detections.
- other minor changes


2008-09-19  Version 0.81
New features:
- added support for custom priority settings. Priority is one of the
optional profile attributes
- added new log messages that display a warning if there are no valid
application profiles, or if an application profile does not match any
running process when program starts. Requires LogLevel=4

New file releases:
- added release for 64 bit versions of Windows

Bug fixes:
- fixed a rare race condition that could have caused processes to be missed
and later ignored if the target process was loading at the same time
AffinityChanger was checking for new processes.
- other minor cleanups.


2008-09-11  Version 0.8
